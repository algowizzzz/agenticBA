The query returned no results (None), which suggests that there is no data for JPMorgan Chase on October 15, 2020, in the report_daily_exposures table.\n\nThis could be due to several reasons:\n\n1. The date '2020-10-15' is not present in the database. The sample data we can see shows a date in 2025, so it's possible that the database doesn't contain historical data from 2020.\n\n2. There might not be any trades recorded for JPMorgan Chase on that specific date.\n\n3. The data in the database might not go back as far as 2020.\n\nTo get a more informative answer, you might want to:\n\n1. Check the range of dates available in the report_daily_exposures table.\n2. Verify if there are any records for JPMorgan Chase in the report_daily_exposures table.\n3. If you're looking for the most recent data, you might want to query for the latest available date instead of a specific historical date.\n\nWithout more information or data, I cannot provide the total Net MTM exposure for JPMorgan on October 15, 2020.",
