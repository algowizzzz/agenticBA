  "result": "Based on the analysis performed by the specialized ccr_sql_query_tool (SQL Database Expert for CCR Reporting Data), here is the response to your query: \n\nThe tool has generated an SQL query to calculate the total exposure_usd, notional_usd, and mtm_usd for JPMorgan Chase & Co. The query joins the daily exposures table with the counterparties table and sums up the relevant fields for the specified counterparty. \n\nWhile we don't have the actual numerical results, this query would typically return three values:\n\n1. total_exposure_usd: The sum of all exposure in USD for JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n2. total_notional_usd: The sum of all notional amounts in USD for JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n3. total_mtm_usd: The sum of all mark-to-market values in USD for JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThese totals would give you a comprehensive view of the aggregate risk and position with JPMorgan Chase & Co. across all transactions in the CCR reporting database. To get the actual numbers, this query would need to be executed against the live database.",
