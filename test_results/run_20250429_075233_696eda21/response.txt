  "status": "success",
  "result": "Based on the analysis performed by the specialized ccr_sql_query_tool (SQL Database Expert for CCR Reporting Data), here is the response to your query:\n\nThe tool generated a SQL query to identify counterparties that have exceeded their Gross Exposure limit. However, no specific results were returned in this instance. This could mean one of several things:\n\n1. There are currently no counterparties that have exceeded their Gross Exposure limit.\n2. The data in the CCR reporting database might not be up to date.\n3. There might be an issue with the database connection or query execution.\n\nTo get a definitive answer, I recommend:\n\n1. Verifying that the CCR reporting database is up to date with the most recent exposure and limit data.\n2. Checking if there are any technical issues with the database connection or query execution.\n3. If needed, manually running the provided SQL query against the ccr_reporting.db to confirm the results.\n\nThe SQL query used attempts to find counterparties where their total exposure in USD exceeds their limit amount in USD, which is the correct approach for identifying limit breaches. If you need more specific information or if you want to investigate further, please let me know, and we can refine the query or investigate any potential technical issues.",
