Azure Growth: Microsoft was aggressively growing its Azure cloud platform. By the end of 2017, Azure\'s run-rate was estimated to be more than $6 billion.\n\n2. Competition with Amazon: Microsoft was positioning Azure to compete directly with Amazon Web Services (AWS). There were indications that Azure could potentially overtake Amazon as a leader in the cloud space.\n\n3. Global Expansion: Microsoft planned to extend its cloud computing presence into Africa by opening two big data centers there in 2018, indicating a strategy of global expansion.\n\n4. Enterprise Focus: Microsoft\'s strategy included a strong focus on enterprise cloud computing offerings.\n\n5. Market Growth: The cloud computing market was growing rapidly, estimated at $14.4 billion for the third quarter of 2017, up 43% from the previous year.\n\n6. Government Contracts: Microsoft was competing for large government contracts, which later resulted in Azure winning a $10 billion contract over AWS.\n\n7. Integrated Cloud Services: Microsoft\'s "Intelligent Cloud" segment, which includes Azure, server products, and enterprise services, showed strong growth, with revenue rising 23% to $14.6 billion.\n\n8. Commercial Cloud Success: Microsoft\'s "commercial cloud" unit reached a $20 billion annual run rate, putting it on par with Amazon in terms of scale.\n\nThese points suggest that Microsoft\'s cloud strategy in 2017 was focused on aggressive growth, global expansion, enterprise solutions, and direct competition with market leaders like Amazon Web Services.'}
