  "result": "Based on the analysis performed by the specialized ccr_sql_query_tool (SQL Database Expert for CCR Reporting Data), I'm unable to provide a definitive list of counterparties that exceeded their Gross Exposure limit recently. The tool generated a SQL query to retrieve this information, but no results were returned. This could mean one of two things:\n\n1. There are currently no counterparties exceeding their Gross Exposure limit in our CCR reporting database.\n2. There might have been an issue with executing the query or retrieving the data.\n\nTo get a more conclusive answer, it would be advisable to verify the data in the CCR reporting system directly or consult with the risk management team for the most up-to-date information on limit breaches. If you need further clarification or have any other questions about counterparty risk exposures, please don't hesitate to ask.",
