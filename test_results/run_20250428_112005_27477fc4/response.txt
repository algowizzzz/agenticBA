It seems that the database doesn't contain the exact quarterly data we're looking for. \n\nTo provide a more accurate answer, we would need financial data for the quarters ending on March 31, 2017 (Q1 2017) and March 31, 2016 (Q1 2016). Without this specific data, I cannot calculate the exact revenue growth for Apple in Q1 2017.\n\nIf you'd like, I can modify the query to look for the closest available data or provide a different analysis based on the available information. Would you like me to do that, or do you have a different question about the available data?",
