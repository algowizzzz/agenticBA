Recent reports suggest that China has quietly rolled back tariffs on some US semiconductor products, potentially easing pressure on its tech sector.\n\n2. There were concerns that higher tariffs on Chinese imports could significantly increase the prices of tech products. For example, analysts predicted that the price of a top-end Apple iPhone could jump to $2,300 from $1,599 under a 54% tariff rate.\n\n3. President Trump had previously indicated new tariffs on smartphones, computers, and some other electronics, but there have been signs of potential delays or exemptions for certain consumer tech products.\n\n4. The US has recently set new duties as high as 3,521% on solar imports from four Southeast Asian countries, which could impact the renewable energy tech sector.\n\n5. US tariffs on most imports from China had reached 145% as the two countries exchanged retaliatory measures. However, there are reports that the White House is considering reducing these tariffs to 50%-65%.\n\n6. Despite high tariffs, China's trade remained steady in April, partly because many electronics were excluded from the duties.\n\nThese developments suggest a complex and evolving situation regarding international trade tariffs, with potential significant impacts on the tech industry, particularly in areas such as semiconductors, consumer electronics, and renewable energy technology. The situation remains fluid, with ongoing negotiations and policy adjustments from both the US and China.",
