  "result": "Based on the analysis attempted by the specialized ccr_sql_query_tool (SQL Database Expert for CCR Reporting Data), I regret to inform you that we encountered an error while trying to retrieve the requested information. The error message indicates a syntax issue in the SQL query used to access the CCR reporting database. \n\nUnfortunately, this means I'm unable to provide the total exposure_usd, notional_usd, and mtm_usd for JPMorgan Chase at this time. This could be due to various reasons, such as:\n\n1. A potential mismatch between the query format and the database structure.\n2. Possible issues with the database connection or access rights.\n3. The specific counterparty name \"JPMorgan Chase\" might not match exactly with how it's stored in the database.\n\nTo resolve this, I would recommend:\n\n1. Verifying the exact name used for JPMorgan Chase in the database.\n2. Checking the database schema to ensure we're using the correct table and column names.\n3. Having a database administrator or the development team review the SQL query syntax and database connection.\n\nI apologize for the inconvenience. If you need this information urgently, you might consider reaching out to the CCR reporting team or the database administrator for direct assistance.",
