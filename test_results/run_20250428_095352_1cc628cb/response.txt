The database query failed due to a syntax error.\n\nTo provide you with the requested information, I recommend we try an alternative approach:\n\n1. We could attempt to query the database again with a simplified SQL query to retrieve the raw revenue figures for Q1 2020 and Q1 2019 separately.\n\n2. If that doesn't work, we could use the financial_news_search tool to look for reliable financial reports or news articles that might contain this information.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with either of these alternatives to find Apple's revenue growth for Q1 2020?",
