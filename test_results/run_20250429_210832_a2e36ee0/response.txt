The most recent total revenue figure mentioned is $261.8 billion, but this is noted as \"ttm\" (trailing twelve months), not a single quarter.\n\n2. For the upcoming quarter (which would be Q3 of fiscal year 2024), analysts are expecting revenue of around $68.38 billion to $68.43 billion. This represents an expected growth of about 10-11% year-over-year.\n\n3. In the previous quarter (Q2 FY2024), Microsoft beat analysts' revenue expectations by 1.1%, but the exact figure isn't provided in these results.\n\nTo get the most accurate and recent quarterly revenue figure, you might want to check Microsoft's latest earnings report directly from their investor relations website, as the information in news articles can sometimes lag behind the most current data.",
