  "result": "Based on the analysis performed by the specialized financial_sql_query_tool (SQL Database Expert for Historical Financial Data), I cannot provide the exact closing price for MSFT on October 25, 2018. The tool generated a SQL query to fetch this information, but did not return the actual price data. The query it would use to retrieve this information is:\n\nSELECT close\nFROM daily_stock_prices\nWHERE ticker = 'MSFT' AND date = '2018-10-25'\nLIMIT 1\n\nThis indicates that the data should be available in the database, but we don't have direct access to the result at this time. To get the actual closing price, we would need to execute this query on the financial_data.db database. I apologize for not being able to provide the specific price you requested.",
