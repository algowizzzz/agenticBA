# Bank Regulatory Filing Collection System

## Project Summary
We've successfully built a specialized system for collecting, processing, and analyzing regulatory filings from major global and Canadian banks. The system focuses on extracting core filing data from official SEC feeds to provide authoritative and structured regulatory information.

## Implemented Features

### Data Sources
- **SEC RSS Feeds**: Direct connection to SEC.gov's official RSS feeds for current filings, press releases, company announcements, quarterly and annual reports
- **Company-Specific Filtering**: Target specific bank institutions through ticker symbols and name recognition
- **Filing Type Detection**: Support for all major SEC filing types (8-K, 10-Q, 10-K, etc.)

### Core Functionality
1. **Collection Pipeline**:
   - Feed retrieval from SEC.gov
   - Company matching using multiple detection methods
   - Filing extraction and structured saving
   - Custom bank-specific directories

2. **Processing Capabilities**:
   - Intelligent named entity recognition for bank detection
   - Support for aliases and alternative names
   - Filtering by filing types and date ranges
   - Handling of both real-time and archive data

3. **Analysis Components**:
   - Filing date/frequency visualization
   - Document type distribution
   - Content pattern recognition
   - Comparative bank metrics

## Current Implementation

We've created:

1. **Base Collector (`sec_feed_collector.py`)**:
   - Generic SEC feed processing
   - Company detection algorithm
   - Structured data storage

2. **Bank-Specific Collector (`bank_sec_collector.py`)**:
   - Support for top 15 global banks and top 5 Canadian banks
   - Expanded naming aliases for accurate detection
   - Customized output formats for banking sector

3. **Testing Tool (`test_jpm_collector.py`)**:
   - Focused JPMorgan Chase collector
   - Enhanced detection sensitivity
   - Sample generation for testing

4. **Batch Processing (`download_bank_filings.sh`)**:
   - Sequential collection of all filing types
   - Segregated global/Canadian bank collections
   - Built-in analysis execution

## Collected Data Structure

For each bank filing, we collect:
- Core metadata (ticker, company name, filing date)
- Filing type and ID
- Full document content
- Source links and CIK identifiers
- Publication dates and processing timestamps

## Key Banking Sector Insights Available

This system enables extraction of valuable insights such as:

1. **Regulatory Events**
   - Material changes requiring disclosure
   - Investigations and enforcement actions
   - Compliance status changes

2. **Risk Profiles**
   - Credit risk exposure updates
   - Market risk assessments
   - Operational risk metrics
   - Cybersecurity incidents

3. **Capital and Liquidity**
   - Capital adequacy ratios
   - Stress test results
   - Liquidity coverage metrics
   - Dividend and buyback policies

4. **Strategic Developments**
   - Mergers and acquisitions
   - Geographic expansion
   - New product launches
   - Digital transformation initiatives

## Usage Instructions

### Quick Start
```bash
# For all banks and all filing types
./download_bank_filings.sh

# For a specific test with JPMorgan Chase
python test_jpm_collector.py
```

### Custom Collection
```bash
# Only global banks
python bank_sec_collector.py --global-only

# Only specific filing types
python bank_sec_collector.py --filing-types 10-K 8-K

# Limit collection size
python bank_sec_collector.py --max-per-feed 50
```

## Scaling Considerations

For scaling this system to handle larger data volumes:

1. **Technical Enhancements**
   - Implement incremental downloads based on latest collected timestamp
   - Add parallel processing for multiple banks simultaneously
   - Create a database backend for more efficient querying
   - Add transaction support to prevent partial data updates

2. **Data Source Expansion**
   - Add international regulatory sources:
     - SEDAR (Canadian Securities Administrators)
     - FCA (UK Financial Conduct Authority)
     - ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority)
     - APRA (Australian Prudential Regulation Authority)
   - Include financial news API integration
   - Add earnings call transcript processing

3. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Implement NLP for sentiment analysis on filing text
   - Create time-series analysis for key metrics
   - Build comparative dashboards across banking sector
   - Develop anomaly detection for unusual disclosures

## Next Steps

1. **Short-term Improvements**
   - Add CIK-based lookups for more precise filing matching
   - Implement pagination for larger feed retrieval
   - Create an automated scheduling system
   - Add email notifications for significant filings

2. **Mid-term Development**
   - Build a web interface for data browsing
   - Create bank-specific dashboards
   - Implement XBRL data extraction for standardized metrics
   - Add historical backfill capabilities

3. **Long-term Vision**
   - Full banking sector coverage (not just top 20)
   - Real-time alerting system
   - Integration with financial analysis tools
   - AI-driven predictive insights from filing patterns

## Limitations and Considerations

- Only covers banks with SEC filings (primarily US-listed or with ADRs)
- Historical data limited to current SEC feed content
- Non-US banks may have different reporting requirements and formats
- Complex filings may require additional parsing logic

## Getting Started

1. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install feedparser requests beautifulsoup4 matplotlib
   ```

2. Ensure proper directory structure:
   ```
   mkdir -p data/raw/sec data/processed/sec data/reports/sec
   ```

3. Run the download script:
   ```
   ./download_bank_filings.sh
   ```

4. Explore collected filings in `data/processed/sec/`
