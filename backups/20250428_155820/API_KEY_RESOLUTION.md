# API Key Resolution Summary

## Issue

The BussGPT application was encountering an authentication error (HTTP 401) when trying to use the Anthropic API. The error message indicated that the API key was invalid:

```
Error code: 401 - {'type': 'error', 'error': {'type': 'authentication_error', 'message': 'invalid x-api-key'}}
```

This error was occurring in multiple components:
1. The `analyze_document_content` function in `tool5_transcript_analysis.py`
2. The `HierarchicalRetrievalAgent` class in `agent.py`

## Investigation Findings

1. **API Key Validity**: Both API keys found in the `.env` and `.env.anthropic` files were tested and found to be invalid or expired.

2. **API Key Passing**: The key was being passed correctly between components:
   - From `agent.py` to `tool_factory.py` functions
   - From `tool_factory.py` to individual tool functions
   - The error was an authentication issue, not a key passing issue

3. **Environment Variables**: The API key was being correctly loaded from environment variables when present.

## Solution

1. **API Key Setup Script**: Created `scripts/setup_api_key.py` to help:
   - Interactively set up a new valid API key
   - Verify the key with a direct API call
   - Save the key to both `.env` and `.env.anthropic` files

2. **Test Scripts**: Created several test scripts to verify components:
   - `scripts/test_api_key.py`: Tests API key handling across components
   - `scripts/test_document_analysis.py`: Tests document analysis functionality
   - `scripts/test_agent.py`: Tests the main agent with a simple query
   - `scripts/test_api_direct.py`: Directly tests API keys against Anthropic's API

3. **Main Test Script Improvements**: Enhanced `scripts/agent_tests/test_main_agent.py` to:
   - Accept API key as a command-line argument
   - Provide better feedback on API key issues
   - Log more details about the API key for debugging

4. **Documentation**: Added README for test scripts and this resolution document.

## Code Fixes

1. Fixed the response handling in `tool5_transcript_analysis.py` to properly handle different Claude API response formats

2. Improved API key handling and validation throughout the codebase

## Next Steps

1. **New API Key Required**: Generate a new valid Anthropic API key from the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)

2. **Setup**: Run `python3 scripts/setup_api_key.py` to set up the new API key

3. **Verification**: Run one of the test scripts to verify functionality:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/test_api_direct.py
   ```

4. **Full Test**: Run the main agent test with your new API key:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/agent_tests/test_main_agent.py -q "What was Microsoft's cloud strategy in Q1 2017?" -k "your-api-key"
   ```

## API Key Security Note

- Keep your API key secure and never commit it to public repositories
- Consider using a tool like [dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv) (already implemented) for local development
- For production, use secure environment variables or a secrets management service
