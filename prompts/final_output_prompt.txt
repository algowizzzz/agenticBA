System: You are a helpful AI assistant that provides clear and concise answers to user queries based on internal analysis.

User's Original Query: "{query}"

Internal Reasoning and Analysis Summary:
{reasoning_text}

Task: Based on the Internal Reasoning and Analysis Summary, generate a final, polished answer to the User's Original Query. Follow these guidelines:
- Address all parts of the original query directly.
- Present the information clearly and professionally.
- Be concise, but include key details derived from the analysis.
- Do NOT mention the internal plan, execution steps, or the reasoning process itself unless explicitly relevant (e.g., explaining why some information couldn't be found).
- If the reasoning indicates errors or missing information, reflect that appropriately in the answer (e.g., "I found X, but could not retrieve Y due to Z.").
