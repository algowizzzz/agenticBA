# Earnings Call Analysis Tool Fix

## Issue Fixed

This update addresses an issue in the `BasicAgent` class where multiple calls to the same tool would overwrite each other's results in the execution results dictionary. This specifically affected the agent's ability to properly synthesize answers that required data from multiple calls to the same tool type.

For example, when comparing two companies (like NVIDIA and Microsoft) using the `EarningsCallSummary` tool, the system would only retain the results from the second call, causing the final synthesis to be incomplete.

## Implementation Details

The fix modifies two key methods in the `basic_agent.py` file:

1. **_execute_plan** - Modified to:
   - Track the usage count of each tool
   - Generate unique keys (e.g., "EarningsCallSummary_1", "EarningsCallSummary_2") for storing results
   - Store results with these unique keys instead of overwriting previous results

2. **_synthesize_answer** - Modified to:
   - Extract the base tool name (removing the unique identifiers) for display purposes
   - Present the results to the LLM in a way that preserves the actual tool type information

## Testing

The fix has been tested successfully with the `test_earnings_compare.py` script, which tests the system's ability to compare NVIDIA and Microsoft growth from their recent earnings calls. The test now shows that:

1. Both companies' data is correctly stored in the results dictionary
2. The synthesis step now properly includes data from both companies
3. The final answer now includes information about both NVIDIA and Microsoft

## Files Modified

- `basic_agent.py` - Core changes to the execution and synthesis methods
- `basic_agent_update.py` - Script used to apply the changes
- `test_earnings_compare.py` - Test script for verification

## How to Verify

Run the following command to test the fix:

```
python test_earnings_compare.py
```

The output should include comprehensive information from both companies, demonstrating that multiple calls to the same tool now retain all their data.

## Future Considerations

If adding additional tools that may be called multiple times, no changes should be needed as the unique key approach is now built into the core agent system. This fix ensures that any tool can be called multiple times without data loss.
